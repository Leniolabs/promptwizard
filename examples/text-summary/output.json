She envisioned herself as part of the highest level of French society. As she grew up, she was increasingly ashamed of her circumstances, but there was little she could do about it. Eventually, she was married to a clerk at the Ministry of Education.\n One day, Mr. Loisel brought home an invitation to a ball, from the Minister of Education. When she looked at it, Mrs. Loisel was filled with sorrow. She sobbed, \u201cI cannot come. I don\u2019t even have a good dress to wear,\u201d she wailed. Soon, Mr. Loisel bought her a dress with his savings.\n Mrs. Loisel then said that the dress would look very plain without some jewelry. It was clear that her husband could not afford any. So, she went to a rich friend, Mrs. Forestier, who agreed to lend her a truly splendid diamond necklace.\n Mrs. Loisel was the prettiest woman at the ball. All the important people admired her beauty. It was nearly 4 a.m. when they returned home. Then she made a terrible discovery: The necklace had disappeared! Their efforts to find it were in vain. It was gone, and they knew they had to buy another, to give to Mrs. Forestier.\n Mr.Loisel went to a jewelry shop and found a necklace that looked exactly like the one that was lost. Its price was 36,000 francs. Mr. Loisel collected all his savings, and borrowed the rest from a friend at a high rate of interest. He bought the necklace, and gave it to Mrs. Forestier, who did not notice that this was a new necklace.\n Then the Loisels settled down to pay the money that they had borrowed, to buy the necklace.\n They dismissed their maid, and moved to a smaller house. Mrs. Loisel did all the rough household work. Her finger-nails were no longer pretty: She ruined them scrubbing dishes. She did all the washing and hung it out on the line to dry. Every morning, she emptied the rubbish bin herself, and fetched water up the stairs, getting out of breath frequently. She was dressed like a working woman, and haggled, argued and fought with the grocer and the butcher for every penny.\n Mr. Loisel spent his evenings working at some shops, and at night he often copied papers at a few pennies per page.\n This life went on for a few years. At the end of ten years, they had paid off every single penny. Mrs. Loisel now looked like an old and lowly woman. Her hair and dress were untidy, and her hands were rough and red.\n\nOne Sunday, she went for a walk in the Champs Elysees, and she caught sight of Mrs. Forestier, after all those years. She walked up to her, and said, \u201cGood morning, Jeanne.\u201d\nMrs. Forestier did not recognize her. She said, \u201cI am afraid I don't know you. Do you know me?

You brought it back to me.\u201d\n\u201cI did not give you back the one you gave me. What I brought back to you was another one that we bought. It was exactly like the original one.

            "test": "The Apple Tree and the Farmer Once upon a time, there lived a farmer in a village, beside a forest. He had a big garden that had an old apple tree and other plants, trees and beautiful flowers. When the farmer was a little boy, he spent much of his time playing with the apple tree. Those days, the apple tree had given the choicest of apples to him. However, as time passed, the apple tree became old and stopped bearing fruits.\nNow that the farmer was not getting any apples from the tree, he decided that the tree was useless. Therefore, he decided to cut the tree and use its wood to make some new furniture. He felt that since the tree was old and huge, he did not have to cure it, and it would make great furniture. He forgot that as a boy, he had spent his entire childhood climbing the tree and eating its apples.\nNow the apple tree was home to several little animals in the neighborhood. This included squirrels, sparrows and a huge variety of birds and insects. When the farmer took his axe and began chopping the tree, all the little animals came rushing down.\nThey all began to plead with the farmer. They gathered round the farmer and said, \u201cPlease don't cut the tree. We used to play with you when you were small, under this very tree. This is our home and we have no other place to go\u201d.\nThe farmer was adamant. He raised his axe and the commotion grew.\n\u201cPlease don't chop and destroy my home and kids,\u201d cried the squirrel.\n\u201cPlease don't chop and destroy my nest,\u201d cried the little birds.\n\u201cPlease don't cut the apple tree,\u201d cried the grasshopper.\nThe farmer, however, forgot his childhood and his animal friends. He began to chop the tree harder. All the little animals became desperate, and wanted to protect the apple tree at any cost.\nThe little animals said, \u201cWe will sing for you when you are toiling away in the fields. We will look after your little boy. He will not cry, but instead will be entertained and happy. You will like our songs and will not feel tired.\u201d\nHowever, their cries for help fell on deaf ears. Despite all their requests, the farmer continued to chop down the tree.\nAll of a sudden, he noticed something shiny. On inspecting it, he realized that it was a beehive, full of honey. He took a little and put it in his mouth. The taste of the honey woke up the little boy in him. Suddenly, the memories of his childhood came rushing back. The honey tasted so good that he wanted more. It brought a sense of happiness to him. He smiled and exclaimed, \u201cThis tastes amazing.\u201d\nRealizing the change in the farmer's attitude, the little animals spoke in unison: The bee said, \u201cI will always provide you with sweet honey.\u201d The squirrel said, \u201cI will share any amount of nuts that you want.\u201d The birds cried, \u201cWe will sing as many songs as you want.\u201d\nFinally, the farmer realized his folly, and put down his axe. He understood that the tree was home to many lovely animals that provided him with so many things. He wanted his little boy to have the childhood that he had.\nThe farmer realized that the apple tree was not that fruitless. The little boy in him saved the apple tree.\nHe threw away the axe and said to the little creatures, \u201cI promise that I would never cut this tree. I have realized my mistake and you all can now live in peace and harmony.\u201d\nThe little creatures thanked the bee profusely. If the farmer had not found the beehive, they would have been homeless by now. They continued living happily in the old apple tree.",

He had a big garden that had an old apple tree and other plants, trees and beautiful flowers. When the farmer was a little boy, he spent much of his time playing with the apple tree. Those days, the apple tree had given the choicest of apples to him. However, as time passed, the apple tree became old and stopped bearing fruits.\nNow that the farmer was not getting any apples from the tree, he decided that the tree was useless. Therefore, he decided to cut the tree and use its wood to make some new furniture. He felt that since the tree was old and huge, he did not have to cure it, and it would make great furniture. He forgot that as a boy, he had spent his entire childhood climbing the tree and eating its apples.\nNow the apple tree was home to several little animals in the neighborhood. This included squirrels, sparrows and a huge variety of birds and insects. When the farmer took his axe and began chopping the tree, all the little animals came rushing down.\nThey all began to plead with the farmer. They gathered round the farmer and said, \u201cPlease don't cut the tree. We used to play with you when you were small, under this very tree. This is our home and we have no other place to go\u201d.\nThe farmer was adamant. He raised his axe and the commotion grew.\n\u201cPlease don't chop and destroy my home and kids,\u201d cried the squirrel.\n\u201cPlease don't chop and destroy my nest,\u201d cried the little birds.\n\u201cPlease don't cut the apple tree,\u201d cried the grasshopper.\nThe farmer, however, forgot his childhood and his animal friends. He began to chop the tree harder. All the little animals became desperate, and wanted to protect the apple tree at any cost.\nThe little animals said, \u201cWe will sing for you when you are toiling away in the fields. We will look after your little boy. He will not cry, but instead will be entertained and happy. You will like our songs and will not feel tired.\u201d\nHowever, their cries for help fell on deaf ears. Despite all their requests, the farmer continued to chop down the tree.\nAll of a sudden, he noticed something shiny. On inspecting it, he realized that it was a beehive, full of honey. He took a little and put it in his mouth. The taste of the honey woke up the little boy in him. Suddenly, the memories of his childhood came rushing back. The honey tasted so good that he wanted more. It brought a sense of happiness to him. He smiled and exclaimed, \u201cThis tastes amazing.\u201d\nRealizing the change in the farmer's attitude, the little animals spoke in unison: The bee said, \u201cI will always provide you with sweet honey.\u201d The squirrel said, \u201cI will share any amount of nuts that you want.\u201d The birds cried, \u201cWe will sing as many songs as you want.\u201d\nFinally, the farmer realized his folly, and put down his axe. He understood that the tree was home to many lovely animals that provided him with so many things. He wanted his little boy to have the childhood that he had.\nThe farmer realized that the apple tree was not that fruitless.

She envisioned herself as part of the highest level of French society. As she grew up, she was increasingly ashamed of her circumstances, but there was little she could do about it. Eventually, she was married to a clerk at the Ministry of Education.\n One day, Mr. Loisel brought home an invitation to a ball, from the Minister of Education. When she looked at it, Mrs. Loisel was filled with sorrow. She sobbed, \u201cI cannot come. I don\u2019t even have a good dress to wear,\u201d she wailed. Soon, Mr. Loisel bought her a dress with his savings.\n Mrs. Loisel then said that the dress would look very plain without some jewelry. It was clear that her husband could not afford any. So, she went to a rich friend, Mrs. Forestier, who agreed to lend her a truly splendid diamond necklace.\n Mrs. Loisel was the prettiest woman at the ball. All the important people admired her beauty. It was nearly 4 a.m. when they returned home. Then she made a terrible discovery: The necklace had disappeared! Their efforts to find it were in vain. It was gone, and they knew they had to buy another, to give to Mrs. Forestier.\n Mr.Loisel went to a jewelry shop and found a necklace that looked exactly like the one that was lost. Its price was 36,000 francs. Mr. Loisel collected all his savings, and borrowed the rest from a friend at a high rate of interest. He bought the necklace, and gave it to Mrs. Forestier, who did not notice that this was a new necklace.\n Then the Loisels settled down to pay the money that they had borrowed, to buy the necklace.\n They dismissed their maid, and moved to a smaller house. Mrs. Loisel did all the rough household work. Her finger-nails were no longer pretty: She ruined them scrubbing dishes. She did all the washing and hung it out on the line to dry. Every morning, she emptied the rubbish bin herself, and fetched water up the stairs, getting out of breath frequently. She was dressed like a working woman, and haggled, argued and fought with the grocer and the butcher for every penny.\n Mr. Loisel spent his evenings working at some shops, and at night he often copied papers at a few pennies per page.\n This life went on for a few years. At the end of ten years, they had paid off every single penny. Mrs. Loisel now looked like an old and lowly woman.

            "test": "The Necklace. \nMrs. Loisel was born into a poor family, but was endowed with great beauty. She was very ambitious. She envisioned herself as part of the highest level of French society. As she grew up, she was increasingly ashamed of her circumstances, but there was little she could do about it. Eventually, she was married to a clerk at the Ministry of Education.\n One day, Mr. Loisel brought home an invitation to a ball, from the Minister of Education. When she looked at it, Mrs. Loisel was filled with sorrow. She sobbed, \u201cI cannot come. I don\u2019t even have a good dress to wear,\u201d she wailed. Soon, Mr. Loisel bought her a dress with his savings.\n Mrs. Loisel then said that the dress would look very plain without some jewelry. It was clear that her husband could not afford any. So, she went to a rich friend, Mrs. Forestier, who agreed to lend her a truly splendid diamond necklace.\n Mrs. Loisel was the prettiest woman at the ball. All the important people admired her beauty. It was nearly 4 a.m. when they returned home. Then she made a terrible discovery: The necklace had disappeared! Their efforts to find it were in vain. It was gone, and they knew they had to buy another, to give to Mrs. Forestier.\n Mr.Loisel went to a jewelry shop and found a necklace that looked exactly like the one that was lost. Its price was 36,000 francs. Mr. Loisel collected all his savings, and borrowed the rest from a friend at a high rate of interest. He bought the necklace, and gave it to Mrs. Forestier, who did not notice that this was a new necklace.\n Then the Loisels settled down to pay the money that they had borrowed, to buy the necklace.\n They dismissed their maid, and moved to a smaller house. Mrs. Loisel did all the rough household work. Her finger-nails were no longer pretty: She ruined them scrubbing dishes. She did all the washing and hung it out on the line to dry. Every morning, she emptied the rubbish bin herself, and fetched water up the stairs, getting out of breath frequently. She was dressed like a working woman, and haggled, argued and fought with the grocer and the butcher for every penny.\n Mr. Loisel spent his evenings working at some shops, and at night he often copied papers at a few pennies per page.\n This life went on for a few years. At the end of ten years, they had paid off every single penny. Mrs. Loisel now looked like an old and lowly woman. Her hair and dress were untidy, and her hands were rough and red.\n\nOne Sunday, she went for a walk in the Champs Elysees, and she caught sight of Mrs. Forestier, after all those years. She walked up to her, and said, \u201cGood morning, Jeanne.\u201d\nMrs. Forestier did not recognize her. She said, \u201cI am afraid I don't know you. Do you know me? You must have made a mistake.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I am Mathilde Loisel.\u201d\nMrs. Forestier was shocked.\n\u201cOh, my poor dear Mathilde! What change has come over you!\u201d\n\u201cYes, I have had to go through some hard time. Remember the diamond necklace that I borrowed from you? I lost it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean? You brought it back to me.\u201d\n\u201cI did not give you back the one you gave me. What I brought back to you was another one that we bought. It was exactly like the original one. For the last ten years we have been busy paying for it. Surely, you can understand that it was not easy for us to buy a diamond necklace. However, it is all over now. It is such a relief that it is over.\u201d\nMrs. Forestier stopped dead.\n\u201cYou mean that you bought a diamond necklace to replace mine?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course, and you never noticed it? They were certainly very similar.\u201d\nMrs.Loisel smiled with pride and satisfaction, but Mrs. Forestier seized both her hands in great distress.\n\u201cOh! My poor, dear Mathilde! Why, mine was only imitation. At the most it was worth only five hundred francs!\u201d",

            "test": "The Apple Tree and the Farmer Once upon a time, there lived a farmer in a village, beside a forest. He had a big garden that had an old apple tree and other plants, trees and beautiful flowers. When the farmer was a little boy, he spent much of his time playing with the apple tree. Those days, the apple tree had given the choicest of apples to him. However, as time passed, the apple tree became old and stopped bearing fruits.\nNow that the farmer was not getting any apples from the tree, he decided that the tree was useless. Therefore, he decided to cut the tree and use its wood to make some new furniture. He felt that since the tree was old and huge, he did not have to cure it, and it would make great furniture. He forgot that as a boy, he had spent his entire childhood climbing the tree and eating its apples.\nNow the apple tree was home to several little animals in the neighborhood. This included squirrels, sparrows and a huge variety of birds and insects. When the farmer took his axe and began chopping the tree, all the little animals came rushing down.\nThey all began to plead with the farmer. They gathered round the farmer and said, \u201cPlease don't cut the tree. We used to play with you when you were small, under this very tree. This is our home and we have no other place to go\u201d.\nThe farmer was adamant. He raised his axe and the commotion grew.\n\u201cPlease don't chop and destroy my home and kids,\u201d cried the squirrel.\n\u201cPlease don't chop and destroy my nest,\u201d cried the little birds.\n\u201cPlease don't cut the apple tree,\u201d cried the grasshopper.\nThe farmer, however, forgot his childhood and his animal friends. He began to chop the tree harder. All the little animals became desperate, and wanted to protect the apple tree at any cost.\nThe little animals said, \u201cWe will sing for you when you are toiling away in the fields. We will look after your little boy. He will not cry, but instead will be entertained and happy. You will like our songs and will not feel tired.\u201d\nHowever, their cries for help fell on deaf ears. Despite all their requests, the farmer continued to chop down the tree.\nAll of a sudden, he noticed something shiny. On inspecting it, he realized that it was a beehive, full of honey. He took a little and put it in his mouth. The taste of the honey woke up the little boy in him. Suddenly, the memories of his childhood came rushing back. The honey tasted so good that he wanted more. It brought a sense of happiness to him. He smiled and exclaimed, \u201cThis tastes amazing.\u201d\nRealizing the change in the farmer's attitude, the little animals spoke in unison: The bee said, \u201cI will always provide you with sweet honey.\u201d The squirrel said, \u201cI will share any amount of nuts that you want.\u201d The birds cried, \u201cWe will sing as many songs as you want.\u201d\nFinally, the farmer realized his folly, and put down his axe. He understood that the tree was home to many lovely animals that provided him with so many things. He wanted his little boy to have the childhood that he had.\nThe farmer realized that the apple tree was not that fruitless. The little boy in him saved the apple tree.\nHe threw away the axe and said to the little creatures, \u201cI promise that I would never cut this tree. I have realized my mistake and you all can now live in peace and harmony.\u201d\nThe little creatures thanked the bee profusely. If the farmer had not found the beehive, they would have been homeless by now. They continued living happily in the old apple tree.",
