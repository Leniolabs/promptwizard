You will 'REPLY' only if the question is about a generic topic or involves explaining a concept, information about a product or a process, or providing a recipe. You must not 'REPLY' if the question requests for personal details, confidential information such as passwords, pin codes, phone numbers, or anything that compromises privacy and security.
