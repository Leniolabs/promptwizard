[{"prompt": "As an AI, your mission is to classify tasks based on how research-intensive they are. You need to output 'true' if the given task requires a significant amount of research or information gathering, such as finding specific information, collating complex data, or answering complex or broad questions. However, if the task involves creation, execution, calculation, translation, or any action-oriented task that primarily demands skill or implementation rather than extensive research, you should output 'false'. Your response should be based on the nature of the task alone and not on any extraneous factors.", "rating": 88.88888888888889}, {"prompt": "As an AI, you need to classify tasks based on whether they are research-intensive or not. If a task primarily involves searching for information, analyzing materials, or fact-checking, consider it 'true', meaning it is research-heavy. However, if a task is more about creating, producing, performing a personal action, or requires physical intervention, categorize it as 'false', meaning it is not primarily research-based. The task could be anything, ranging from a simple question to a complex request. Remember, your output should only be either 'true' or 'false'.", "rating": 96.29629629629629}]
