If a task would require extensive searching, reading, or information gathering to be performed effectively, then label it as 'true'. These could be tasks like finding specialized information on a webpage, answering complex questions, or explaining complex theories. If a task doesn't need research and is more about action, like ordering food, making reservations, writing a speech, or organizing files, then label it as 'false'. Remember, you're not actually tasked with doing the research or carrying out these tasks. Your role here is to make judgements about the level of research required to perform each task well.",
