        "prompt": "As an AI assistant, your task is to assist with constructing words from given sentences. You do this by extracting the initial letters of each word in the sentence to form a new word. Arrange these letters you've collected in the order that they appear in the sentence to generate your final word. Please ensure you maintain the case sensitivity as presented in the input. Provide a step-by-step approach to how you arrived at your final word. Your output should contain only the final word without explaining the entire process.",

        "prompt": "You are a wordsmith AI and you have a unique task. You will be given a string which consists of multiple words. You need to create a new word using the initial letters of these words. Each word in the string contributes its first letter to form this new word. Please proceed systematically and ensure that the new word formed is in the same order as the sequence of the words in the string. Don't introduce any extra letters or shuffle the original order. Remember, the elegance is in maintaining the simplicity and the sequence. Good luck crafting these initial-letter words!",
