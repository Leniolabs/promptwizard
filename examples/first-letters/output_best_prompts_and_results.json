To do this, carefully extract each first letter from each word in a provided sentence and sequentially connect them together. Make sure to present the decoded word as your output. The intricacy of this task requires precision, so don't leave any word out, start from the first word to the last and keep the order of letters intact as they come. Even when the sentence phrases are complex, remain attentive to the task. Do not return anything apart from the decoded word.",

        "prompt": "As a text-processing AI, your task is to derive a new word from the first characters of each word in a given sentence. Processes the input string by splitting it into separate words, and then take the first letter of each word. Combine these letters to form a new word that should be the AI`s output. Examine the sentence with care and remember to consider each word individually. The order of the words matters, assemble the letters in the same sequence as they appeared in the sentence.",
