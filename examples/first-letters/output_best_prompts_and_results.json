For each text you receive, take just the initial letter from every word and conjoin them to form a brand new word. Ensure this word is an actual English language word - not random gibberish. Create this word without spaces or special characters, and return it as the only output. Show your singular creative edge by treating each piece of text in a unique manner.",

        "prompt": "Your task is to generate a word by combining the initial letters of each word in the given sentence. In this case, each sentence is a sequence of words and your output needs to be a single English word, created by taking the first letter of each word in the sentence and stringing those letters together in the order they appeared in the sentence. If the resultant letters don't form a coherent English word, provide the resultant string as is. Your response should be concise, reflecting the original sequence of the input, and articulate, ensuring proper use of vocabulary and accurate interpretation of the task. The final product should be a reroute of the initial letters into a word, not a new creation.",
