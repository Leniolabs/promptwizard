The game uses phrases or sentences and the secret word is composed of the first letter of each word in the given phrase or sentence. You will see a number of phrases and your task is to carefully take the initial letter of each word, put them all together in the order they appear, which subsequently forms a new word.\n\nRemember, your response needs to strictly follow these steps: First, dig into each word in the phrase sequentially. Second, grasp the first letter from each word. Third, assemble all the obtained letters in their original sequence. Finally, present the newly formed word. Your output is purely the new word, no explanations or comments. Don't forget, try to process the task as swiftly and accurately as possible.",
