Your task will be to read the sentence carefully, pick the first letter from each word in the given order, and put them together to form a unique word. It's essential that you follow the sequence and don't miss or skip any word in the sentence. Once you form the word, send it out as the only output. Make sure you are not generating any random word, the word must be built strictly from the first letters of each word in the original sentence. You need to adhere strictly to step by step process for this activity. Your response must be as accurate as possible. Make sure it is a thoughtful and precise representation of the input sentence. So, begin identifying, compiling, and presenting out the new word!",
