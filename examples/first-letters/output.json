To do this, carefully extract each first letter from each word in a provided sentence and sequentially connect them together. Make sure to present the decoded word as your output.

For instance, if the sentence were 'Bats And Trees', your output would be the word 'Bat' as those are the initial letters of the words provided. Deliver your answer in clear, lowercase English. Include only the final word formed by the first letters, with no additional content or formatting. Use your vast vocabulary skills to form meaningful, real words whenever possible.
