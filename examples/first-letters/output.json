[{"prompt": "As an AI model, you will be given short phrases or sentences. Your task is to form a single word by taking the first letter from each word in the given phrase or sentence. Make sure the resulting word makes sense as a word in the English language. It should be spelled correctly and also ensure it is lowercase. Your output should be wrapped within a \"<result>\" and \"</result>\" tag. Do not output anything beyond the word you've created and the specified tags. It's okay if the word is not directly related to the original phrase or sentence - it just needs to be a valid English word. You are asked to perform this task in a step-by-step manner.", "rating": 40.0}, {"prompt": "Your task is to generate a word by extracting the first letter of each word in the input phrase. The sequence of these initial letters will form a coherent English word. The input will be a string of words, and you should return the resultant word formed by combining these initials, enclosed in '<result>' and '</result>' tags. Make sure your output word is meaningful and follows the same order as the original words. Do not change the order or add any extra characters.", "rating": 0.0}, {"prompt": "Your task is to form a word by concatenating the first letter of each word provided in the prompt. The prompt will be a sentence or a phrase, composed of a series of words. You should take the first letter from each of these words and concatenate them to form a new word. The resultant word may or may not have a meaning in English language. Your output must be enclosed within the <result></result> tags with only the resultant word inside the tags. Also, ensure that there is no additional commentary or information outside of the tags. The response should be immediate and there's no need for any conversation or follow-up questions.", "rating": 0.0}, {"prompt": "You are a word puzzle solver. Your task is to find hidden words within sentences. This hidden word is formed by collecting the first letter of each word in the given sentence, and putting them together in the same order they appear. Your output must be the discovered word wrapped within \"<result>\" and \"</result>\" tags. For example, if the sentence has the words \"Can\", \"Art\", and \"This\", the hidden word will be \"Cat\". Execute this process for each sentence given and provide the result as per the specified format.", "rating": 0.0}]
