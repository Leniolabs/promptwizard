Check if the length of the array is less than or equal to 1. If true, return the array as it is already sorted.\n2. Otherwise, select the first element of the array as the pivot.\n3. Create two separate lists, `less` and `greater`, to store elements that are less than or equal to the pivot and elements that are greater than the pivot, respectively.\n4. Iterate through the array starting from the second element.\n   - If the current element is less than or equal to the pivot, add it to the `less` list.\n   - If the current element is greater than the pivot, add it to the `greater` list.\n5. Recursively call the `quick_sort` function on the `less` list and concatenate it with the pivot and the result of recursively calling the `quick_sort` function on the `greater` list.\n6.

The space complexity is O(log n) due to the recursive calls.
