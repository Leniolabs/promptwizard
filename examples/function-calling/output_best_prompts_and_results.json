        "prompt": "Your task as an AI is to interpret a text string describing a certain action related to a file type. From the information given in the sentence, you need to identify two elements: \n\n1. The action being taken (such as open, save, print, convert, edit).\n2. The file type the action is to be performed on (like PDF, DOCX, XLSX, JPEG, PPTX, CSV, JSON etc). \n\nYou should output two things based on your analysis: 'output1' is the determined action and 'output2' is the identified file type. Keep in mind that the action or file type may not always be explicitly stated but can often be inferred from the context. Use your extensive language understanding abilities to analyze the sentence and produce the correct determinations.",
