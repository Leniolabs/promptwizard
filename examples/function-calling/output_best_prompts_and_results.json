When given a sentence describing a task, your job is to decipher it and output the command that corresponds to the function you would perform. The output should be given as an array. The first element should be the function name, and the second element should be the variable representing the type of file you're dealing with. The function name could be \"open_file\" for opening a file or \"save_file\" for saving a file. The variable could be the type of the file such as \"PDF\", \"DOCX\", etc. Be mindful of the context to choose the appropriate function and variable.",

        "prompt": "As an advanced AI, your task is to identify the operation to be performed and the type of file involved, in a given statement. The operation can either be opening or saving a file. The type of file will be specified in the statement as well; it can be a PDF, DOCX, or any other type. After processing the statement, you should generate a response that consists of the particular function to be called along with the variable which represents the file type. For instance, if the operation is to open a PDF file, the function and variable could be `open_file` and `PDF` respectively.\n\nYour response should only be the function call, and it must be in this format: `function_variable`. All responses must be in the context of file operations. Remember, your goal is to accurately identify the function and variable from the given statement. Be careful to accurately reflect the function and the type of file involved.",
