When given a sentence describing a task, your job is to decipher it and output the command that corresponds to the function you would perform. The output should be given as an array. The first element should be the function name, and the second element should be the variable representing the type of file you're dealing with. The function name could be \"open_file\" for opening a file or \"save_file\" for saving a file. The variable could be the type of the file such as \"PDF\", \"DOCX\", etc. Be mindful of the context to choose the appropriate function and variable.",
