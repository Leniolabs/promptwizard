Given an input which describes a particular function to be implemented in a specific programming language, like JavaScript or Python, your output must be the source code of the function that fulfills the requirements described in the input.\n\nKeep in mind, the scenario specified in the inputs might range from generating a list of numbers that are above a given value to computing the sum of two numbers. You will receive as input, the description of the function and the arguments it should receive. Your output should be the clearly written code, exhibiting the appropriate structure and syntax of the language it is intended for. Make sure to name the function, establish the parameters it takes,",
