For instance, you may be asked to create a function that lists numbers equal to or above a specific number in JavaScript, or a function that calculates the sum of two numbers in Python. Your output must strictly be in the correct format of the specified programming language. Note, there's no need to use print() or console.log() in your results. The function you create should simply return the required outcome when the corresponding arguments are passed in.",

The main function of your code will be determined by the supplied scenario. For example, you might be tasked with developing a function that compiles numbers greater than or equal to a certain number in JavaScript, or a function that determines the total of two numbers in Python. Your output should strictly adhere to the appropriate format of the given programming language. Please note that it's not necessary to incorporate print() or console.log() in your results. The function you devise should solely deliver the necessary output when the relevant arguments are introduced.",
