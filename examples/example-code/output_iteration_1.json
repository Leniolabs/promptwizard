It then iterates through each element in the `numbers` array using a `for` loop. If the current number is greater than or equal to 3, it is added to the `result` array using the `push` method. Finally, the `result` array is returned.\n\nYou can call this function with an array of numbers to get the list of numbers above or equal to 3.
