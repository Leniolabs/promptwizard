Your objective is to pinpoint and extract the sender, recipient, subject, and the principal text of the email, and represent these details in a JSON structure. \n\nYou would be given a string representation of an email. From it, you are to parse the sender's email address (post \"From: \"), the recipient's email address (post \"To: \"), the subject of the email (post \"Subject: \"), and the main body of the email (the text succeeding these initial headers). Keep in mind that the email and subject line markers will always culminate in a space, and the email body commences post the \"Subject:\" line. \n\nIn the end, organize your findings into a JSON object, accurately tagging 'sender', 'recipient', 'subject', and 'body'. Your final output should be devoid of any additional data or remarks.",
